With "Blind Image Steganograph" you can hide text or arbitrary files within an image without changing its perceptual quality significantly using Blind Image Steganography which stores the data in the [Least Significant Bits (LSB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_numbering#Least_significant_bit) and thus does not need the original image when extracting the data.

You are free to copy, modify, and distribute "Blind Image Steganograph" with attribution under the terms of the MIT license.
